# QuietSpace

> _Get (["deep"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_2a_jsGYw))
creative work **done**_.

## _Why_?

> `As a` ***creative person*** (_writer/designer/developer/videographer_)<br />
> `I need` a **_quite_ place** to get my **work _done_** (_without interruptions_) <br />
> `So that` I can ***be/feel productive***
We want to _share_ that environment with other like-minded creative people.

## What?

A co-working space located at 16 Palmers Rd, London, E2 0SY, United Kingdom

### Desk Rental Rates >> _Simple/Transparent Pricing_

+ Monthly Subscription **£170/desk** (_hot desk + clean desk policy_)
+ Pay-as-you-Go £11/day

> "Old" Pricing: http://www.founderlondon.com/images/workhere.jpg
> Discussion: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme/issues/42


## How? (_Proposal_)

We need to make QuietSpace the most _productive_ working environment in London.
Our "metric" for this should be a "hybrid" NPS/Productivity score

> Mark will formulate exactly how to calculate this and capture the data
  from all members on an on-going basis.

### TODO

+ [ ] Membership Registration System (_can be a spreadsheet for MVP_)
but ideally would link to payment processing/verification so it's clear who has paid.
+ [ ] Desk allocation system (_so people can reserve a specific desk if they want to_)


### Fixed Overheads (_Costs we have to cover_)

We calculate our pricing based on our need to cover ***Fixed Overheads***:
+ Rent: £2500 (_please input exact number_)
+ Rates: £500
+ Electricity: £200/month
+ Cleaning: £100/month
+ Internet: £100/month
+ Insurance: £50/month
+ "Free" Tea & Coffee: £50/month  (_please define a monthly budget_)

Total _Fixed_ Costs: £3,600

> _**Question**: should we **budget** for an **Office Manager**? (part time?)_
please discuss: https://github.com/dwyl/quietspace/issues/25

### Number of Desks

+ Upstairs: 16 Seats, 2 Standing Desks
+ Downstairs: 12 Seats, 2 Standing Desks

### _Potential_ Revenue at "_Full Capacity_"

32 Places @ £170/month = **£5,440**

Which means that we _could_ either accumulate a surplus and spend it
on making the space nicer for everyone, or we can lower prices once
we reach full capacity.

Either way, I don't think lowering the prices _now_ is a good idea
because it _de-values_ the place and signals "_we'll take anyone_" ...


### Constraints

+ Bathroom (Toilet) Facilities ...

### Suggestion Improvements (_for discussion_)

+ [ ] Leave door to F&C and QuietSpace open during the day so _both_ Toilets
can be used by members.
+ [ ] A Green lightbulb outside the bathroom linked to the bathroom light so people
can see from a glace if it's free. This can bee hooked up using IoT
+ [ ] Oil diffusers (_pleasant smell_)
+ [ ] Whiteboards (_fixed to the wall?_)
+ [ ] "Free" Fresh Fruit?
+ [ ] Bring a friend (_first day is free but they need to register
  with valid email address/phone number for insurace purposes_)
+ [ ] "Sign-up your friends as memebers" _10% discount_ applied to both members?
+ [ ] Cost _Decreases_ For Everyone as Membership Increases?
+ [ ] Lockers? (_with actual locks ... please open issue to discuss_)
+ [ ] Desk Numbering?
+ [ ] QR Codes on Desks so people "Check-in" for the day?
+ [ ] ***Meetups***? Can we hold meetups in the space e.g. 19:00 - 20:30?
crucially will they add value to the members?
+ [ ] Register for VAT? https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration-thresholds we don't
need to. is there any point in collecting paying VAT...?

### Value-Added Services for Small One-Person-Companies

+ [ ] Registered Address for Freelancers/Ltd Co. (_included in membership_)
+ [ ] Mail forwarding for people who are working remotely but still want a fixe address
for the company/invoices etc.
+ [ ] Mail opening, scanning and email service. (_most "registered office" providers have this service_)
