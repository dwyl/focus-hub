# QuietSpace

> _Where London's most creative people go to get (["deep"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_2a_jsGYw)) work **done**_.

![quiet-please-wall-art](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/23511482/1cbe7720-ff55-11e6-8f21-82753e5dab6a.jpg)

## _Why_?

There are _hundreds_ of co-working spaces/offices in London,
so why do we **_need_ another one**?

> `As a` ***creative person*** (_writer/designer/developer/videographer_)<br />
> `I need` a **_quite_ place** to get my **work _done_** (_without interruptions_) <br />
> `So that` I can ***be/feel productive***. <br />

> As the members of QuietSpace want to _share_ that environment with other like-minded creative people.

### `QuietSpace`'s _Mission_ is to curate the most <br />_creatively productive_ working environment in London.

## What?

### A Co-Working Space Located at 16 Palmers Rd, London, E2 0SY

### World-Class Meetup & Training Venue

Part dwyl's of our mission to help everyone discover what they love doing requires us to share our knowledge through Meetups and training.

We have _already **successfully**_ used the space for training both
our own team members, our clients and complete strangers.

Our plan is to create a _public_ training calendar for QuietSpace
where specific training is regular.

#### What Will We Learn?

We already have a [52+](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Adwyl+learn)
tutorials in various levels of "maturity" which we plan to convert into video content by recording a "complete beginners workshop"

We have a _rough **order**_ for the learning material:
https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues/69 but we expect to be "_dynamic_" and will respond to the requests/needs of the attendees/members.




#### Training Registration System

For the QuiteSpace-based training we will need a
registration system/process so people can
book a space on the training for a specific day/time.
(_The **MVP** can use an
**existing "booking" tool** provided we capture all the requirements
before making a decision. as always we **prefer open source**._)




### QuietSpace Timetable for Co-Working, Breaks and Meetups/Training

The most productive people in the world all have a well-defined Timetable for getting their work done.

|Start - End    | Description |
|---------------|-------|
| 04:00 - 06:00 | Healthy food preparation (_upstairs available for work, expect some noise will be made downstairs_) |
| 06:00 - 07:00 | Self-guided Yoga / Pilates / Mindfulness (Downstairs), Reading or Quiet work Upstairs |
| 07:00 - 10:00 | "Early Bird's" Focus Time (_absolute silence please this is when we get our best work done_) |
| 10:00 - 10:30 | Morning break (_moderate chat/noise acceptable_) |
| 10:30 - 12:30 | Morning Focus Time (_please whisper or use "instant messaging" to communicate_) |
| 12:30 - 14:00 | Lunch Break (_moderate chat/noise acceptable though please be respectful of people working through lunch_) |

## How? (_Proposal_)

Our "***metric***" for this should be a "hybrid" NPS/Productivity score.

> Mark will formulate exactly how to calculate this and capture the data
  from all members on an on-going basis. This is one of our USPs so getting regular data/feedback is essential.

### TODO

+ [ ] **Market _Validation_**
  + [ ] Create a basic survey (_using your choice of survey tool_)
  with ***questions*** (_proposed_):
    + [ ] Where do you get your most valuable work done?
    + [ ] What time of day are you most productive?
    + [ ] On a scale of 1 - 5
    (_where 1 is **disagree strongly** and 5 is **agree strongly**_)
    + I work best when in a quiet environment.
    + I regularly wear earphones to block out noise
    when I'm trying to concentrate on my work.
    + I find it difficult to get back into my work if I am interrupted.
    + I like to openly discuss my work with my co-workers and pick their brains without calling a "formal" meeting.
  + [ ] Collect responses to the survey by using Google Adwords
  to target people who are searching for "London Co-Working" direct them to the survey.
  + [ ] Use Google Analytics to track response/dropout rate.
+ [ ] ***Membership Registration/Management*** System (_can be a [**spreadsheet**](https://github.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server) for MVP with a view to using our [CRM](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/161) after MVP_)
but ideally would link to the ***payment processing***/verification so it's clear who has paid.

+ [ ] Monthly/Pay-as-you-Go **Payment Collection** System (_e.g: GoCardless_)

+ [ ] **Desk allocation** system (_so people can **reserve** a **specific desk**
  if they want to and we **know** when we're "**full**"_)

+ [ ] **Check-in** system when people arrive (_also useful for fire safety_)

+ [ ] Anonymous ***feedback*** system so people can complain if they feel the need to?
see: https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/183

> Making the QuiteSpace Co-working space a success
is an _integral_ part of dwyl's wider mission.
Having a productive place for our London-based team
to work is _essential_ for in-person collaboration.


### _Fixed_ Overheads (_Costs we have to Cover_)

We calculate our pricing based on our need to cover ***Fixed Overheads***:
+ Rent: £2500 (_please input exact number_)
+ Rates: £500
+ Electricity: £200/month
+ Cleaning: £100/month
+ Internet: £100/month
+ Insurance: £50/month
+ "Free" Tea & Coffee: £50/month  (_please define a monthly budget_)

Total _Fixed_ Costs: £3,600

> _**Question**: should we **budget** for an **Office Manager**? (part time?)_ <br />
_please discuss_: https://github.com/dwyl/quietspace/issues/25

### Number of Desks

+ Upstairs: 16 Seats, 2 Standing Desks
+ Downstairs: 12 Seats, 2 Standing Desks

### _Potential_ Revenue at "_Full Capacity_"

32 Places @ £170/month = **£5,440**

_actual_

Which means that we _could_ either accumulate a surplus and spend it
on making the space nicer for everyone, or we can lower prices once
we reach full capacity.

Either way, I don't think lowering the prices _now_ is a good idea
because it _de-values_ the place and signals "_we'll take anyone_" ...


### Constraints/Blockers

+ Bathroom (Toilet) Facilities ...
(_possible mitigation in suggestions below_)
+ Locker/Storage space
+ Lots of junk lying around upstairs and [downstairs]()

### Suggestion Improvements (_for discussion_)

+ [ ] Leave door to F&C and QuietSpace open during the day so _both_ Toilets
can be used by members.
+ [ ] A Green lightbulb outside the bathroom linked to the bathroom light so people
can see from a glace if it's free. This can bee hooked up using IoT
+ [ ] Oil diffusers (_pleasant smell_)
+ [ ] Whiteboards (_fixed to the wall?_)
+ [ ] "Free" Fresh Fruit?
+ [ ] Bring a friend (_first day is free but they need to register
  with valid email address/phone number for insurace purposes_)
+ [ ] "Sign-up your friends as memebers" _10% discount_ applied to both members?
+ [ ] Cost _Decreases_ For Everyone as Membership Increases?
+ [ ] Lockers? (_with actual locks ... please open issue to discuss_)
+ [ ] Desk Numbering?
+ [ ] QR Codes on Desks so people "Check-in" for the day?
+ [ ] ***Meetups***? Can we hold meetups in the space e.g. 19:00 - 20:30? crucially will they add value to the members and wider community?
+ [ ] Register for VAT? https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration-thresholds we don't
need to. is there any point in collecting paying VAT...?

### Value-Added Services for Small One-Person-Companies

+ [ ] Registered Address for Freelancers/Ltd Co. (_included in membership_)
+ [ ] Mail forwarding for people who are working remotely but still want a fixe address
for the company/invoices etc.
+ [ ] Mail opening, scanning and email service. (_most "registered office" providers have this service_)
