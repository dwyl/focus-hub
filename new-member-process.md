## Process for welcoming new members to FocusHub

### Before member's first day 
* Send note confirming...
  * rates
  * (refundable) deposit amount
  * house rules
* Request member brings in photo ID for our records on first day
* Request details for our records
  * Their name
  * Billing contact name
  * Company name, address, region (e.g. England and Wales), and reg number
  * Their contact email (presumably we already have this) and phone number
  * Accounts contact email if applicable
* Arrange with member when they're coming in on their first day and ensure someone's there to welcome them
* Ensure set of keys available / get set cut
* Update Member Details spreadsheet with the above
* Generate member agreement using Autocrat (see [instructions](https://github.com/dwyl/process-handbook/issues/70)) if applicable, or manually change the `<<tags>>` in the agreement template (docs in Drive / FH private / Legals); export to PDF, electronically sign it, then forward to member and ask for electronic signature
* Set up on FreeAgent
  * First set them up as a contact
  * Then go to `recurring invoices` and go through the steps outlined below, making sure it's still marked as a draft

### First day
* Welcome member, give them keys, wifi code
* Explain about 24hr access and locking up, & general house rules
* Remind them of Quiet Time during Power Hours
* Ensure we have all requested info, including taking a picture of ID
  * If not, gently remind them
  * If so, file away in the FH Drive, making sure it's in the *private* `Focus Hub (private) > Tenants` folder
* Check the draft recurring invoice on FreeAgent, and activate it
* Send a one-off invoice for the deposit

## Process for getting a recurring invoice set up for members

* First set up the member as a `contact` (if they're not already)
* In the horizontal menu, go to Work > Invoicing and on the next screen go to **Recurring Invoices**
* Click **Add Recurring Profile**
* Select the `contact`, leave the `project` blank
* (Ignore `Starting Reference`, this will be set automatically)
* Set the start date and frequency (along with end date if that's known, unlikely)

* Under `Invoice emails`, tick to send invoices and thank yous, but not reminders (screenshot)
* Create the profile!
* On the next screen, hit the green `Add invoice item` button and select the item from the price list (e.g. Monthly Hotdesk), or add a new invoice item and tick to add it to the price list
* Once you've added this and finished the process, the invoice is set to `draft` - you must `activate` it before it's.... ummm... `active`
* If you need to pause the recurrence, or just stop the invoices going out, set the profile to `draft` again.
