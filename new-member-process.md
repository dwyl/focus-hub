## Process for welcoming new members to FocusHub and getting them set up on FreeAgent

**Before member's first day** 
* Send note confirming...
  * rates
  * (refundable) deposit amount
  * house rules
* Request member brings in photo ID for our records on first day
* Request details for our records
  * Their name
  * Billing contact name
  * Company name, address, region (e.g. England and Wales), and reg number
  * Their contact email (presumably we already have this) and phone number
  * Accounts contact email if applicable
* Arrange with member when they're coming in on their first day and ensure someone's there to welcome them
* Ensure set of keys available / get set cut
* Update Member Details spreadsheet with the above
* Generate member agreement using Autocrat (see [instructions](https://github.com/dwyl/process-handbook/issues/70)) if applicable, or manually change the `<<tags>>` in the agreement template (docs in Drive / FH private / Legals); export to PDF, electronically sign it, then forward to member and ask for electronic signature
* Set up on FreeAgent
  * First set them up as a contact
  * Then go to `recurring invoices` and go through the steps there, making sure it's still marked as a draft

**First day**
* Welcome member, give them keys, wifi code etc.
* Explain about 24hr access and locking up etc.
* Remind them of Quiet Time during Power Hours
* Ensure we have all requested info, including taking a picture of ID
  * If not, gently remind them
  * If so, file away in the FH Drive
* Check the draft recurring invoice on FreeAgent, and activate it
* Send a one-off invoice for the deposit
