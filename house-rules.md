## House Rules

Focus Hub is a lovely and welcoming shared space, and we want to make sure it stays that way! So we ask all Members to keep the House Rules in mind when they're here.

If you have any questions at all, just grab one of the team or email hello@focushub.co.uk.

### Please...

* Treat all other Members with **courtesy and respect**
* Respect the Daily **Power Hours** by keeping noise to a minimum between *11am - 12pm & 3pm - 4pm*
* **Wash up and dry** any crockery/utensils you use before you leave for the day
* **Remember what you've put in the fridge**, and when. For hygiene reasons, anything past its use-by date might be disposed of without warning
* *Fixed deskers*: **keep your desks tidy** and the areas around you free from obstacles or fire hazards
* *Hotdeskers*: **completely clear away the desk you've used at the end of each day** - you can't "save" a desk by leaving possessions on it overnight
* If you're here after hours or on weekends, make sure to **turn off all the lights _and heaters_ before locking up** as you leave

### Please don't...

* Be excessively loud or disruptive
* Use Focus Hub for anything other than office space
* Use parts of the space which aren't communal or specifically assigned to you (e.g. shelves, lockers, storage space)
* Share your keys (or your membership) with anyone else

### IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

* First make sure you're safe. Leave the space and call 999 immediately if there is a fire, or if anyone is injured
* As long as you're not in any danger, contact one of the Focus Hub managers
  * [Insert contact details]
